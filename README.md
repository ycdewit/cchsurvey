<b>CCHS The Next GenRation: Tools for Analyzing CCHS data from 2015+</b><br>
An R package for analyzing Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) data from Statistics Canada. Uses the survey package by Thomas Lumley and creates easy-to-use dataframes for making tables and graphs. Specifically designed for comparing geographic regions (i.e. comparing public health unit estimates to the peer group and province). Novice R programmer (~ 6 months of using R) - very open to feedback and/or collaboration. :)

Currently lacking proper documentation, will add ASAP.
